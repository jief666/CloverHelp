# Working together.

### Now we share a repo together. Good.

#### Each I'd like you to make a test, unless told differently, you'll have to :

* -&gt;`cd {Clover partition}/EFI`
* -&gt; `git fetch`
* -&gt; `git pull`
* Reboot. If it crash, or black screen, give it few seconds and then reboot on your backup solution.
* -&gt;`cd {Clover partition}/EFI`
* -&gt; `git add -A && git commit -m "{commit description}" && git push`
* Drop a message in the issue you've opened, so I get a notification.

#### Do not copy file in and out this folder.

If you want to modify something, of course you can. After it's done, commit :  
-&gt; `cd {Clover partition}/EFI`  
-&gt; `git add -A && git commit -m "{commit description}" && git push`
