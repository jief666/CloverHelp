# Terms & conventions.

### **«**`and`**»**

Each I need to type something, or want to write an exact string of chars, I'll use « before and » after.  
If I write : type `«git fetch»` in terminal, enter `git fetch`.  
If I write : it should answer `«blabla»`, means you are supposed to get `blabla`. If you were supposed to get `"blabla"`, I'd have written `«"blabla"»`.

Example : If it's written : `«echo "foo" > "{your insanelymac name}"»` I'll type echo "foo" &gt; "Jief\_Machak".

### -&gt; \(at a beginning of a line\)

What's following `->` has to be typed in terminal, followed by enter.

### {your name on insanelymac}

Everything between { and } has to be replaced by what is described in it.  
For me `{your name on insanelymac}` would be `Jief_Machak`.Do not type the { and }!.  
Do not add anything more than what's asked.  
If I need _`"Jief_Machak"`_ \(including the quotes\), I'll write `"{your name on insanelymac}"` instead.

### `Bootloader partition`

This will be the partition we will use together. It's **not** the Clover folder. It's **not** the EFI folder. It's the partition itself.  
It can be a USB stick, it can be an EFI partition on one of your drive.

### `{Bootloader partition}`

Replace this by the path where you `Bootloader partition` is mounted.  
Usually something like /Volumes/EFI, or, if you use a usb stick, /Volumes/{USB stick name}.  
Here, EFI is **not** the folder inside, it's the partition name. **Do not confuse**.
