## Clover partition

This will be the partition we will use together. It's **not** the Clover folder. It's **not** the EFI folder. It's the partition itself.  
It can be a USB stick, it can be an EFI partition on one of your drive.

## {your name on insanelymac}

Everything between { and } has to be replaced by what is described in it.  
For me _{your name on insanelymac}_ would be _Jief\_Machak_.  
Do not add anything more than what's asked. For example, if I need _"Jief\_Machak"_ \(including the quotes\), I'll write _"{your name on insanelymac}"_ instead.
